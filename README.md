# GP Search

GP Search is a web app that shows doctors nearby a location. The app is implemented using a Koa backend and a React frontend, both written in Typescript.

To run both the frontend and backend, you must have Node and Yarn installed. Run `yarn install` and then `yarn start` in the root of the repo. You can now access the web app at [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).


## Stage 1 - Implementing Changes

Detail how you would implement the product changes below.

1. Display doctors near the end user's current location. The app currently only displays doctors near central Glasgow.

2. Display 100 nearby doctors. The app currently only displays 20 doctors.

3. Add a list view of the doctors to be displayed alongside the map. Clicking on a doctor in the list should highlight the doctor on the map and vice versa.
